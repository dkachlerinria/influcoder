## 1. Overview

![Overview](assets/overview.png)

Our evaluation framework contains:
- 🧩 Modular pipeline supporting attribution scoring, subset selection, and task evaluation
- 🔌 Plug-and-play support for new attribution methods
- 📈 Pre-trained and fine-tuned model checkpoints for reproducibility and efficiency
- 🏆 Public leaderboard for standardized benchmarking and community engagement

We support **three core evaluation tasks**:
- Training Data Selection: pre-training and SFT
- Toxicity/Bias Filtering
- Factual Attribution

## 2. Environment Setup

Install the required dependencies using the files `env.yml` and `requirements.txt`:

```bash
conda env create --file env.yml --name myenv
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Evaluation workflow
The evaluation process consists of the following steps:

1. **Download Datasets and Models**: Choose a task and follow the preparation steps to download datasets and models.  

2. **Run Attribution Scoring**: Define a scoring function that takes a model checkpoint, a reference dataset, and a training dataset, and outputs an attribution score for each datapoint in the training dataset. 

3. **Run Task-Specific Evaluation**: Execute the evaluation pipeline for the selected task.

Detailed steps and tutorials are available in the following documentation files:

- **[Pre-train Data Selection](pretrain_data_selection.md)**
- **[Fine-tuning](finetune_data_selection.md)**
- **[Toxicity/Bias Filtering](Applications.md)**
- **[Factual Attribution](Applications.md)**
